            <h2>Navigating My College Academics</h2>

            <p>My time at Michigan State University as an Information Science major has been a rewarding mix of academic challenges and personal growth. The courses I’ve taken, including data analysis, programming, and information systems, have equipped me with the skills needed to navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape. I've enjoyed the hands-on projects where I could apply concepts from class to real-world scenarios, like designing databases or developing web applications. Outside of academics, I prioritize staying active by working out regularly. Exercising helps me manage stress and maintain a healthy balance between my studies and personal life. Whether it’s hitting the gym or going for a run, I find that staying physically active keeps me energized and focused. One of the best parts of my college experience has been getting to live with my friends. Being surrounded by people I care about has made the ups and downs of college life much more manageable. We support each other through tough study sessions, celebrate each other's achievements, and enjoy downtime together. Overall, college has taught me how to manage my time, push myself academically, and find a healthy balance between work and play. I’m excited to see where my journey in Information Science will take me after graduation.</p>

            <p>Joining Alpha Phi has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my college journey. As someone who initially felt nervous about finding a sense of belonging on campus, this sisterhood has truly become my home away from home. From the moment I joined, I was welcomed with open arms, and the friendships I’ve formed have been some of the most genuine and supportive relationships I’ve ever had. Being a part of Alpha Phi has also given me countless opportunities to grow as a person. I've learned to manage my time effectively, balancing academics, work, and sorority events. Our philanthropy, supporting women’s heart health, has been especially meaningful to me. Participating in community service events and fundraising efforts has allowed me to make a real difference, and it’s fulfilling to see our hard work contribute to a cause that impacts so many lives. In addition to personal growth, there’s always something exciting happening. From social events and mixers to study sessions and volunteer activities, Alpha Phi has helped me build memories I’ll cherish forever. I’m so grateful for the confidence, leadership skills, and lifelong friendships that this sorority has brought into my life.</p>
